# Visual Odometry for camera trajectory Tracking
  Using a fisheye lens for Visual Odometry algorithm we aim to recover accurate trajectory of the camera moving in an environment.
  
# Description
  Visual Odometry is a crucial concept in Robotics Perception for estimating the trajectory of the robot (the camera on the robot to be precise).
  With this project we are aiming to use a fisheye lens for Visual Odometry algorithm and to recover accurate trajectory of the camera moving in an environment.
